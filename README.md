malware.detector
================

Visual Basic scripts that provide very basic emergency malware detection on windows computers.


Use this when there is an urgent need to look on the C:\ drive for new malware programs reported by your agencies.

It loops through the filename and hash list, searching drive C:\ on a Windows computer and reports a file with the same MD5 hash.

How to use:

Download one of the scripts and malwaremd5.exe. Then open the script and poplate the NameAndHash array with multiple comma separated lines containing the file name and md5 signature hash. Run the file from an admin account with a double click and wait for warnings. If you do not have admin rights, uac.malware.detection.vbs can be used to launch the same process from a USB giving a chance to elevate by UAC.

Administrators can include this in a startup or shutdown script, running as admin to silently check for threats.

Command Terminal

Empty the NameAndHash array then use the command prompt window for a single file search, using cscript. You could leave array populated too and the manual entry will be appended to the list.

Ex:

    cscript malware.detection.vbs "filename.ext" "MD5HASHSTRING"

Progress reports

If you have a long list of files, and want to know how it is going, change the "reportSearchProgress" variable to true. It will show a dialog box for each file as the search begins.
